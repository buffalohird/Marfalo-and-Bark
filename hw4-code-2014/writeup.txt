Compare the two cases and explain your findings.
		BB has Lower daily revenue: We expect this since, when not bidding truthfully in GSP, a bidder may lower their bid but would not raise their bid. This will lead to over all lower revenues on average.
		BB has Higher expected utility for the bb agent. This is expected since we proved in class that GSP is not an NE for truthful bidding. Using some good method, such as bb, to deviate from truthful bidding will be useful to increase expected utility. 
		BB has Lower average spending: This follows from the other two points since the bb agent will bid weakly less than truthfully. In many situations, a bb agent will spend less, thus spending less on average.

		In these runs, we see 1 bb vs 4 Truthfuls gets an average utility of around $575 which is around $150 higher than the Truthfuls. 1 Truthful loses to the 4 bbs by a much smaller margin, though still notably at around $635 to $616. It is interesting to note that the utility is higher in the case where there are lots of bb agents as opposed to where there are mostly Truthful agents. This makes sense because we expect the bb-dominated to have lower overall prices as opposed to the Truthful agents and, ceteris paribus, we have higher utility with lower prices. 
		Regardless, we see from these trials that it doesn't matter what the rest of the community is doing, one can benefit using the bb strategy as opposed to the Truthful strategy. This is of course only true as long as the payment schedule is detemrined with GSP, VCG should give a different result.
